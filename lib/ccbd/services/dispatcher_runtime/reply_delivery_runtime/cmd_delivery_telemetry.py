# cmd delivery telemetry.
#
# Writes JSONL records to `.ccb/metrics/body_read_followup.jsonl` so rollout
# health can be measured post-hoc. Best-effort only — any write failure is
# swallowed so telemetry never blocks delivery.
#
# Three event families are recorded:
#   header_only_dispatch         long reply went out via the pointer path
#   long_reply_fell_back_full_body  long reply degraded to full-body; reason
#                                   names why (kill_switch_disabled,
#                                   project_root_unavailable, ...)
#   cmd_phase2_failure           claim succeeded but plan or inject raised;
#                                reply is either recoverable on disk or lost
#   cmd_delivery_success         pane inject proceeded because foreground cmd
#                                was on the safe allowlist and ready
#   cmd_delivery_held            pane inject was intentionally held because
#                                the consumer was unsafe or not ready
#
# Without these fallback/failure events, the 1-2 week observation window can
# silently lie about rollout health — a degrade or a crash would look like a
# clean full-body pass. See codex structural review 2026-04-22.
